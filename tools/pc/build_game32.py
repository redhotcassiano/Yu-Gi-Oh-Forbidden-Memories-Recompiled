"""Compile and link the resident game C as a 32-bit Linux or Windows executable.

Bring-up driver for the fixed-address memory model (src/pc/guest/image.h):
  * every game unit is compiled with the host GCC as ILP32;
  * data symbols the units leave undefined or tentative are pinned to their
    retail addresses, read from the matching build's ELF;
  * undefined functions get generated stubs that name themselves and exit,
    unless a native source under src/pc already defines them.
The retail addresses come from config/pc/guest_addresses.txt, which this
script writes from the matching build's ELFs (make match match-overlays)
whenever they are present, so a checkout without the MIPS toolchain builds too.

On Windows the toolchain is llvm-mingw (i686-w64-mingw32-clang, lld and the
llvm binutils) and the libraries come from tools/pc/build_win32_deps.py. PE
differs from ELF in ways the link below works around: C symbols carry a
leading underscore; sections cannot be placed at chosen addresses, so the
fixed game sections (save states across rebuilds) are not available; the
section renames edit the COFF headers directly (rename_coff_sections) and
__start_/__stop_ come from grouped marker sections; overrides win by link order instead of weakened symbols."""
